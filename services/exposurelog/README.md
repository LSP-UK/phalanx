# exposurelog

Deployment of the exposurelog service, which manages a database of log messages associated with exposures.
Similar to narrativelog, but narrativelog messages are not associated with exposures.

exposurelog is developed at https://github.com/lsst-sqre/exposurelog and uses OpenAPI to document the API.
